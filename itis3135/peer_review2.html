    <h3>Evaluation</h3>
    <ul>
      <!-- DESIGN / CHECKLIST -->
      <li><strong>Submission / file setup:</strong> The home page loads correctly and navigation is easy to find at the top of the page.</li>
      <li><strong>Contrast & readability:</strong> White background with dark pink text is easy to read. The darker header bar and buttons stand out well against the lighter pink sides.</li>
      <li><strong>Font usage:</strong> Fonts are consistent across the logo/title, navigation, and main text. The heading font for &quot;Sophie&#39;s Cakeshop&quot; feels on-theme for a bakery.</li>

      <li><strong>CRAP Principles:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Strong contrast between the deep pink header and the light pink side panels. Buttons also pop nicely against the white content area.</li>
          <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Navigation styling, colors, and button shapes are repeated across the page, which keeps the design consistent.</li>
          <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The heading, intro text, and cake image are well centered, giving the site a clean and organized look.</li>
          <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> The welcome heading, dotted divider, and intro paragraph are grouped together, clearly forming one section.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <!-- STRUCTURE -->
      <li><strong>Header / main / footer:</strong> The page clearly has a header with nav, a main content section, and (if present) a footer. Make sure the same structure appears on every page.</li>
      <li><strong>Branding / h1:</strong> &quot;Sophie&#39;s Cakeshop&quot; in the header works well as the site/brand name. Be sure it is coded as an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> somewhere for semantics and accessibility.</li>
      <li><strong>Main heading (h2):</strong> &quot;Welcome to Sophie&#39;s Cakeshop!&quot; is a strong h2 for the home page and sets the tone for the site.</li>
      <li><strong>Tagline / description:</strong> The sentence about custom, made-to-order cakes with unique Asian flavors describes the business clearly and concisely.</li>

      <!-- NAVIGATION -->
      <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Home, About, Menu, Gallery, and Contact are clearly visible in the header. Navigation layout is easy to use and matches the style of the rest of the site.</li>

      <!-- CLIENT PROJECT REQUIREMENTS / PROGRESS -->
      <li><strong>Content pages:</strong> Looks like there are multiple content pages (About, Menu, Gallery, Contact). Make sure each has enough bakery-specific content and consistent layout.</li>
      <li><strong>Images:</strong> Hero cake image is appealing and on theme. Check that all images in the gallery (when complete) have descriptive <code>alt</code> text, like &quot;slice of matcha cake with fruit topping&quot;.</li>
      <li><strong>Menu:</strong> On the Menu page, listing specific cake flavors, sizes, and price ranges would give customers more useful info.</li>
      <li><strong>Gallery:</strong> A gallery with several different cakes (weddings, birthdays, etc.) will really help show variety and quality.</li>
      <li><strong>Contact / inquiry:</strong> The &quot;Start a Custom Order Inquiry&quot; button is great. Be sure the contact or order form collects helpful details (occasion, date, flavor, size, budget).</li>
      <li><strong>Responsiveness:</strong> Layout appears centered and should adapt fairly well, but make sure to test on mobile so that the header, intro text, and buttons don&#39;t feel cramped on smaller screens.</li>

      <!-- SUGGESTIONS: STOP / START / CONTINUE -->
      <li><strong>Stop:</strong> Stop leaving any placeholder text on inner pages; replace it with real menu items, gallery captions, and contact details.</li>
      <li><strong>Start:</strong> Start adding more personality to the copy (for example: signature flavors, story behind the shop, and pickup/delivery info). Also consider adding hover effects to the buttons to make them feel more interactive.</li>
      <li><strong>Continue:</strong> Continue using the cohesive pink color palette and centered layout. It fits the bakery theme very well and makes the site feel warm and welcoming.</li>
    </ul>
