    <h2>About Akaal Farms</h2>
    <p>Akaal Farms is owned by farmer <strong>Sahibdeep Singh</strong>. He grows wheat, rice, corn and other crops, and maintains a ranch with cows, hens and other domestic animals.</p>

    <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <p>Sahibdeep Singh has been farming for over a decade, continuing a family tradition that has been passed down for generations. His farmland is located on the peaceful outskirts of the Charlotte area, where the soil is rich and perfect for growing wheat, rice, and corn. Over the years, he has expanded his operations to include a small ranch with cows, hens, and other domestic animals, creating a well-balanced farm that supports both crops and livestock. Farming is not just his livelihood—it's his passion and a way to stay connected to nature and his community.</p>

<p>He wanted to create this website to help Akaal Farms gain more visibility and connect with local buyers, neighbors, and businesses interested in fresh, locally grown produce. The site also allows him to share updates about seasonal crops, showcase photos of the ranch, and make it easier for people to reach out for partnerships or visits. Beyond business, Sahibdeep hopes the website will help educate the community about sustainable farming practices and celebrate the hard work that goes into growing healthy, local food.</p>
